# Apple HomePlay (Work In Progress)

My take on Apple Home Dashboard Design for Home Assistant.

I'm running Home Assistant OS Supervised VM hosted on a NAS DS920+.
The Wall Mount tablet is a FireHD 10 from amazon running Fully Kiosk Browser.

I'm sharing my configuration there is no install button.

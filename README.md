My take on Apple Home Dashboard Design for Home Assistant. (Work in Progress)

I'm running Home Assistant OS Supervised VM hosted on a NAS DS920+.
The Wall Mount tablet is a FireHD 10 from amazon running Fully Kiosk Browser.

I'm sharing my configuration there is no install button.
There is still a lot of work to be done, the dashboard appear aligned on my tablet but not really in browsers.
